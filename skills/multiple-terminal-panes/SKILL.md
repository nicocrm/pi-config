# Zellij Pi Launcher

Launches a new pi instance in a separate Zellij pane so work happens there, not in the current session.

## Usage

```bash
bash ~/.pi/agent/skills/zellij-pi/launch.sh "<pane-name>" "<working-directory>" "<prompt>" [pi-flags...]
```

Any arguments after the prompt are passed as flags to `pi` (e.g. `--thinking high`).

### Examples

**Implement a plan:**
```bash
bash ~/.pi/agent/skills/zellij-pi/launch.sh "implement-plan" "/path/to/project" "Read docs/plans/2026-03-19-my-plan.md and implement it. Follow all instructions in the plan."
```

**Run with high thinking:**
```bash
bash ~/.pi/agent/skills/zellij-pi/launch.sh "review" "/path/to/project" "Review the code thoroughly." --thinking high
```

**Run any task:**
```bash
bash ./launch.sh "refactor" "/path/to/project" "Refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens"
```

## Important

- The new pi instance runs interactively in a floating pane.
- Do NOT attempt to implement the plan yourself. Your job is only to launch the new pane.
- After launching, confirm to the user that the new pane has been created.
- The prompt sent to pi should be self-contained: include file paths, context, and clear instructions since the new instance has no conversation history.
